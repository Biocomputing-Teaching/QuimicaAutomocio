# Quizes compilation

change only the <date>ExamenXXX.tex file, not the <date>ExamenXXXYYY.tex files, where YYY may be "Preguntes", "Respostes" or "FullRespostes". Such files are automatically generated by the Makefile.

To compile, edit the initial lines in the Makefile and after that type 

```make```

in the command line.
